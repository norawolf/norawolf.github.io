2018 has been a year of big personal transitions, including a cross-country move and a reckoning with the reality that I can’t sustain the current work I’m doing as a massage therapist & bodyworker forever. I’ve always gravitated toward the creative: writing, music, movement, herbal medicine, and many people in my life are surprised by my switch to studying software engineering. 

As a weird kid, the Internet was an early lifeline for me. I started teaching myself HTML, CSS, and Photoshop at a young age to build nerdy fansites, participate in forums, and code skins for my LiveJournal. My corners of the Internet were full of writers, artists, music fans, and LGBTQ+ individuals who utilized the tools of web development to create safe spaces for connection. These formative years exposed me to the power of tech to expand worldviews, build relationships, and empower marginalized individuals to create their own space in the world. 

Tech is political. There are so many examples of harm created on both personal and community-wide levels by the rise of tech industry in urban spaces. I lived in Oakland, California for the last five years and witnessed the devastating effects of gentrification and massive displacement tied to tech’s development throughout the Bay Area. At the same time, I saw new technologies being used as powerful tools for community organizing and mobilization. 

I want to find a way to operate in the tech world that does the least harm, and to be part of what I think is as tech at its best: people creating the tools they need to self-determine; to build a more equitable, accessible world; to decentralize power; to create platforms; and to radically imagine a different future.
